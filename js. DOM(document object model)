Why DOM is required?
HTML is used to structure the web pages and Javascript is used to add behavior to our web pages.
When an HTML file is loaded into the browser, the javascript can not understand the HTML document directly.
So, a corresponding document is created(DOM). 
DOM is basically the representation of the same HTML document but in a different format with the use of objects.
So,  Javascript interprets DOM easily i.e javascript can not understand the tags(<h1>H</h1>) in HTML document 
but can understand object h1 in DOM. 
Now, Javascript can access each of the objects (h1, p, etc) by using different functions.


Structure of DOM:
DOM can be thought of as a Tree or Forest(more than one tree).[Object]
The term structure model is sometimes used to describe the tree-like representation of a document. 
Each branch of the tree ends in a node, and each node contains objects
