HTML DOM:-
DOM(Document Object Model)
The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. 
The DOM defines a standard for accessing documents: 
"The W3C Document Object Model (DOM) is a platform and language-neutral interface that allows programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure, 
and style of a document."
The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can interact with the page.
It is called a Logical structure because DOM doesnâ€™t specify any relationship between objects. 
With DOM, we can easily access and manipulate tags, IDs, classes, Attributes, or Elements of HTML using commands or methods provided by the Document object.

Dom can create the html code as a object(like a tree) make a copy of it so we can able to add or delete(like manipulating) elements, attributes, etc.

How DOM is created?
What is the DOM & How Does HTML Rendering Happen in Browsers ...
Firstly, bytes are converted to HTML characters and then to Tokens. In the next step, Tokens are converted into nodes. Nodes are different objects with certain properties.
 After the nodes are created, the DOM tree is created.
 
 Using DOM, the JavaScript gets access to HTML as well as CSS of the web page and can also add behavior to the HTML elements.
 so basically Document Object Model is an API that represents and interacts with HTML.
