CSS Selectors:
A CSS selector selects the HTML element(s) you want to style.

We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:
Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)
Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)
Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)
Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)

Basic CSS selectors:-
1. element selector:
The element selector selects HTML elements based on the element name.
EXAMPLE:
p {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}
Here, all <p> elements on the page will be center-aligned, with a red text color.

2. id Selector:
The id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element.
The id of an element is unique within a page, so the id selector is used to select one unique element!
To select an element with a specific id, write a hash (#) character, followed by the id of the element.
EXAMPLE:
<style>
#para1 {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>
<p id="para1">Hello World!</p>
<p>This paragraph is not affected by the style.</p>
If there are more then 2 content with same element, you want style only one particular element, 
first add the id="any value" to that particular element and call the id name with # in the selector
Note: An id name cannot start with a number!

3.class Selector:
The class selector selects HTML elements with a specific class attribute.
To select elements with a specific class, write a period (.) character, followed by the class name.
EXAMPLE:
<style>
.five {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>
<h1 class="five">Red and center-aligned heading</h1>
<p class="five">Red and center-aligned paragraph.</p> 
Note:You can also specify that only specific HTML elements should be affected by a class.

4. Universal Selector:
The universal selector (*) selects all HTML elements on the page.
EXAMPLE:
<style>
* {
  text-align: center;
  color: blue;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Hello world!</h1>
<p>Every element on the page will be affected by the style.</p>
<p id="para1">Me too!</p>
<p>And me!</p>

5. Group selector:
The grouping selector selects all the HTML elements with the same style definitions.
Look at the following CSS code (the h1, h2, and p elements have the same style definitions):
h1, h2, p {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}
