CSS is the language we use to style an HTML document.
CSS describes how HTML elements should be displayed.

What is CSS?
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media
CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once
External stylesheets are stored in CSS files

Why Use CSS?
CSS is used to define styles for your web pages, including the design, layout and variations in display for different
devices and screen sizes.

CSS Syntax:
selector{ property:value;
          property:value;
        }

EXAMPLE:
h1{ color:red;
    font-size:20px;
  }
Example Explained:
h1 is a selector in CSS (it points to the HTML element you want to style: <h1>heading).
color is a property, and red is the property value
font-sizeis a property,and 20px is the property value

CSS Selectors:
A CSS selector selects the HTML element(s) you want to style.

We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:
Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)
Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)
Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)
Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)

Basic CSS selectors:-
1. element selector:
The element selector selects HTML elements based on the element name.
EXAMPLE:
p {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}
Here, all <p> elements on the page will be center-aligned, with a red text color.

2. id Selector:
The id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element.
The id of an element is unique within a page, so the id selector is used to select one unique element!
To select an element with a specific id, write a hash (#) character, followed by the id of the element.
EXAMPLE:
<style>
#para1 {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>
<p id="para1">Hello World!</p>
<p>This paragraph is not affected by the style.</p>
If there are more then 2 content with same element, you want style only one particular element, 
first add the id="any value" to that particular element and call the id name with # in the selector
Note: An id name cannot start with a number!

3.class Selector:
The class selector selects HTML elements with a specific class attribute.
To select elements with a specific class, write a period (.) character, followed by the class name.
EXAMPLE:
<style>
.five {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>
<h1 class="five">Red and center-aligned heading</h1>
<p class="five">Red and center-aligned paragraph.</p> 
Note:You can also specify that only specific HTML elements should be affected by a class.

4. Universal Selector:
The universal selector (*) selects all HTML elements on the page.
EXAMPLE:
<style>
* {
  text-align: center;
  color: blue;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Hello world!</h1>
<p>Every element on the page will be affected by the style.</p>
<p id="para1">Me too!</p>
<p>And me!</p>

5. Group selector:
The grouping selector selects all the HTML elements with the same style definitions.
Look at the following CSS code (the h1, h2, and p elements have the same style definitions):
h1, h2, p {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}

How to add CSS:
When a browser reads a style sheet, it will format the HTML document according to the information in the style sheet.

There are three ways of inserting a style sheet:
External CSS
Internal CSS
Inline CSS

1. External CSS
With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire website by adding just one file!
Each HTML page must include a reference to the external style sheet file inside the <link> element, inside the head section.
EXAMPLE:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="mystyle.css">
</head>
<body>
<h1>This is a heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
</body>
</html>
(here they create seprate file for css style and link that file in the html document)
External styles are defined within the <link> element, inside the <head> section of an HTML page.

An external style sheet can be written in any text editor, and must be saved with a .css extension.
The external .css file should not contain any HTML tags.
Here is how the "mystyle.css" file looks:
File name-mystyle.css
body {
  background-color: lightblue;
}
h1 {
  color: navy;
  margin-left: 20px;
}


2. internal CSS:
The internal style sheet is used in the HTMl file inside the <style> element, inside the head section.
EXAMPLE:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>
body {
  background-color: linen;
}
h1 {
  color: maroon;
  margin-left: 40px;
}
</style>
</head>
<body>
<h1>This is a heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
</body>
</html>


3. Inline CSS
An inline style may be used to apply a unique style for a single element.
To use inline styles, add the style attribute to the relevant element. The style attribute can contain any CSS property.
EXAMPLE:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
<h1 style="color:blue;text-align:center;">This is a heading</h1>
<p style="color:red;">This is a paragraph.</p>
</body>
</html>

CSS Comments:
CSS comments are not displayed in the browser, but they can help document your source code.
Comments are used to explain the code, and may help when you edit the source code at a later date.
Comments are ignored by browsers.
A CSS comment is placed inside the <style> element, and starts with /* and ends with */:
EXAMPLE:
/* This is a single-line comment */
p {color: red;}
You can add comments wherever you want in the code.

HTML and CSS Comments:
we use a combination of HTML and CSS comments in the same file.
