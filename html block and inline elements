There are two types of elements:
Inline and block

inline element - does not start on a new line and it only takes up as much width as necessary.
<div> element - it is a block-level and is often used as a container for other HTML elements.
<span> element - it is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document.

A block-level element always starts on a new line, and the browsers automatically add some space (a margin)
before and after the element. 
A block-level element always takes up the full width available


Difference Between Inline and Block Elements in HTML

Block elements always start from a new line. 
Inline elements never start from a new line. 
Block elements cover space from left to right as far as it can go. 
Inline elements only cover the space as bounded by the tags in the HTML element.
