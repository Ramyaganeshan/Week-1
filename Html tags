we can use the global title attribute to show the description for the abbreviation/acronym when you mouse over the element.
EXAMPLE:  <p> The <abbr title="World Health Organization">WHO</abbr> was founded in 1948.</p>

ADDRESS TAG:
<address>
The <address> tag defines the contact information for the author/owner of a document or an article.
The contact information can be an email address, URL, physical address, phone number, social media handle, etc.
The text in the <address> element usually renders in italic, 
and browsers will always add a line break before and after the <address> element.

AREA TAG:
<area>
The <area> tag defines an area inside an image map (an image map is an image with clickable areas).
<area> elements are always nested inside a <map> tag.
EXAMPLE:
 <img src="workplace.jpg" alt="Workplace" usemap="#workmap" width="400" height="379">
<map name="workmap">
  <area shape="rect" coords="34,44,270,350" alt="Computer" href="computer.htm">
  <area shape="rect" coords="290,172,333,250" alt="Phone" href="phone.htm">
  <area shape="circle" coords="337,300,44" alt="Cup of coffee" href="coffee.htm">
</map> 
The usemap attribute in <img> is associated with the <map> element's name attribute,
and creates a relationship between the image and the map.

<audio>
The <audio> tag is used to embed sound content in a document, such as music or other audio streams.
