JavaScript is the programming language of the Web.

developers must learn:
   1. HTML to define the content of web pages
   2. CSS to specify the layout of web pages
   3. JavaScript to program the behavior of web pages

   JavaScript Can Change HTML Content:
One of many JavaScript HTML methods is getElementById().

The example below finds an HTML element (with id="demo"), and changes the element content (innerHTML) to "Hello JavaScript":
<html>
<body>
<h2>What Can JavaScript Do?</h2>
<p id="demo">JavaScript can change HTML content.</p>
<button type="button" onclick='document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello JavaScript!"'>Click Me!</button>
</body>
</html>

In HTML, JavaScript code is inserted between <script> and </script> tags.
You can place any number of scripts in an HTML document.
Scripts can be placed in the <body>, or in the <head> section of an HTML page, or in both.
Scripts can also be placed in external files too.
JavaScript files have the file extension .js.
External scripts cannot contain <script> tags.
To use an external script, put the name of the script file in the src (source) attribute of a <script> tag:
Example
<script src="myScript.js"></script>
You can place an external script reference in <head> or <body> as you like.
The script will behave as if it was located exactly where the <script> tag is located.

External JavaScript Advantages:-
Placing scripts in external files has some advantages:
It separates HTML and code
It makes HTML and JavaScript easier to read and maintain
Cached JavaScript files can speed up page loads
To add several script files to one page  - use several script tags:
Example
<script src="myScript1.js"></script>
<script src="myScript2.js"></script>
