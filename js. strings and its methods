JavaScript strings are for storing and manipulating text.
Whatever written inside the quotes is calls strings.
You can use single or double quotes:

Example
let carName1 = "Volvo XC60";  // Double quotes
let carName2 = 'Volvo XC60';  // Single quotes

String Length:
To find the length of a string, use the built-in length property:

Example
let text = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ";
let length = text.length;
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = length;
OR
let text = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ";
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = text.length;

Escape Character:
Because strings must be written within quotes, JavaScript will misunderstand this string:
let text = "We are the so-called "Vikings" from the north.";
The string will be chopped to "We are the so-called ".
The solution to avoid this problem, is to use the backslash escape character.
The bckslash (\) escape character turns special characters into string characters:

\'	'	Single quote
\"	"	Double quote
\\	\	Backslash
EXAMPLE- let text = "We are the so-called \"Vikings\" from the north.";
let text= 'It\'s alright.';

Extracting String Parts:
There are 3 methods for extracting a part of a string:
slice(start, end)
substring(start, end)
substr(start, length)
String slice()

1.slice() extracts a part of a string and returns the extracted part in a new string.
The method takes 2 parameters: start position, and end position (end not included).
Example
Slice out a portion of a string from position 7 to position 13:
let text = "Apple, Banana, Kiwi";
let part = text.slice(7, 13);

If you omit the second parameter, the method will slice out the rest of the string:
If a parameter is negative, the position is counted from the end of the string:

2.substring()
substring() is similar to slice().
The difference is that start and end values less than 0 are treated as 0 in substring().
If you omit the second parameter, substring() will slice out the rest of the string.

String substr()
substr() is similar to slice().
The difference is that the second parameter specifies the length of the extracted part.

Replacing String Content
The replace() method replaces a specified value with another value in a string:

Example
let text = "Please visit Microsoft!";
let newText = text.replace("Microsoft", "W3Schools");
Note
The replace() method does not change the string it is called on.
The replace() method returns a new string.
The replace() metho replaces only the first match
